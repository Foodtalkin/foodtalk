              <p>            
              On Tuesday, 12th January 2016, there was a meme that was put up by us in what we intended as light humour. Consequently, this stirred up a negative reaction online and amongst many of our followers. We now feel the need to genuinely clarify the turn of unfortunate events that transpired after this meme was posted, and bring to light that our server was Hacked.</p>
              <p>
              Soon after the meme, an article was released by Vagabomb, which of no fault of theirs portrayed us as being sexist. We deeply apologise for our actions and any statements that we have made in content to the post thereafter on any platform and would like to inform you that the meme was deleted soon after.
              </p>
              <p>
              The next day i.e Wednesday 13th Jan’16 another article was published by Vagabomb, bringing to light a response from us with a doodle image, sent to the journalist of an with immature retaliation hosted on our hacked website. The doodle wrongly represents us for having addressed her and Vagabomb in an offensive and uncultured manner. Upon investigation we came to find that our Server had been hacked and traced the email ID to be based out of the Republic of Moldova.
              </p>
              <p>
              At Food Talk India, we do not believe in tainting what we have built with such retaliation. We have added a screen shot for your reference that will confirm that we did not have anything to do with this response, and it was a hack.
              </p>
              <p>
              We would like to reassure you that a sexist, offensive message was not what the intention was when the meme was posted. We would like to sincerely apologize for hurting sentiments and causing offence to many individuals and their beliefs.
              </p>
              <p>
              On Wednesday, 13th January ’16 itself we were persistent about reporting the matter to the Cyber Cell in both Gurgaon and Delhi and further informed the Vagabomb team via email and a phone conversation about the unauthorised access to our server. As on 04:28:00 (server time) our servers were accessed un-authentically from an IP address 14.141.131.138 using FTP and this image was placed during this malicious activity. Our technical team is looking up for more details and we have requested our hosts for the same as IPs can be spoofed easily. We are also trying to get a hold of the fake mail account gurpal@mail.md with which the “doodle” image was sent.
              </p>
              <p>
              Once again, we remain deeply apologetic about the meme and any negative association that was brought forward by that, however we would like to ensure you that we in no way have been associated with the image that was sent out to the journalist.
              </p>
              <p>
              As a brand we have the highest respect for women. And would not trade the lines of sexism in a conscious manner. We deeply regret the incident and will look into this very seriously.
