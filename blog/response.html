            <p>An ex- Google Employee Hacked Food Talk India and sent "Dick Pic" to journalist.
			Will the real ‪#‎DickPic‬ please stand up?</p>
			<p>I usually cock an eyebrow and flash a smile before I say Mr food talk, but thanks to a badly scribbled penis (supposedly mine) and a middle finger (promise they look nothing like this) I'm having to eat my words. Hey, at least my sense of humour is intact.
			A former freelancer at Food Talk and also Ex- Google employee misused his access to our website planted this picture and sent it to the journalist at Vagabomb, sparking off a pretty explosive social media mudslinging match.</p>
			<p>I am the last person to shut up and take blame so I decided to get to the root of it.
			I found that the little spy Gurpal@mail.md had registered to attend one of our event. That was alarming enough and I filed a complaint with the CyberCell in Gurgaon.
			Upon further investigation, the Cyber cell found that the access was from his assigned server and they traced the IP address down to the office where he is currently working in Noida.
			Today the Cyber Cell called him in and confronted him on the “DickPick crime” - yeah even the cops call it that now!</p>
			<p>An official apology has been written to Food Talk, Shibani Bedi and Vagabomb and ScoopWhoop saying he is responsible for the mishap and the legal proceeding will take its due course.(Still waiting for their response, don't think they will pick up this story)</p>
			<p>A plus for effort , not even an F for drawing. Ladies, my food posts are still ‪#‎betterthansex‬</p>
			<p>Sorry, but i shan't be eating humble roti. So here’s getting my story out there, and hoping to earn back the credibility of MrFoodTalk.
